# Haley's Favourite Things

This app is a mobile-first, web-based gallery showing off a few of my favourite things. 

## Requirements 

You'll need Gitbash/Bash/a terminal window, a good browser (this was tested in Chrome) and that's about it!

## Installation

1. Clone the GitHub repository from the repository's webpage into the desired location on your computer.

```bash
git clone [link]
```
2. Import the database into whatever you use to access SQL databases. 
3. Adjust the code to direct fetch functions to the right location in order to access the database.

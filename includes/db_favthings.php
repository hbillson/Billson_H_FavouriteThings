He was born on September 17th, 2019, when my rooomate\'s cat had four kittens while I was at home - so I\'ve been raising him since he was born! He is incredibly well-socialized, so he\'s very popular among my friends and family since he\'s unusually comfortable with being picked up and cuddling. The downside to this is that he\'s very clingy - I get woken up by him crying at my bedroom door quite often at night because he wants to sleep on my bed. ','Image_URL' => 'images/kenobi.jpg'),

When the Moon is very bright, I find myself staring out my window or standing outside just to look at it for no real reason. I hope I can visit it someday. (The pictured image is a 3D model of the Moon that I created in Cinema 4D for an earlier project.)','Image_URL' => 'images/moon.jpg'),
